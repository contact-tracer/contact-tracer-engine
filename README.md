# contact-tracer-engine
Privacy-preserving backend for COVID-19 contact tracing apps.

Our goal is to make a back-end engine that is so useful to developers of contact tracing apps, that it becomes the obvious and de-facto choice. Especially for developers who are indifferent about privacy considerations.

## Preface
Contact tracing is a key part of managing epidemics. It is a labour-intensive process. The scale of the COVID-19 pandemic means auto-recording possible contacts using smartphones is an obvious contribution to scaling up contact tracing.

Our concern is that simplistic designs will compromise privacy, irrevocably. It will be extremely difficult to add privacy later on. Just like the technical and adoption difficulties found trying to retroactively add security to FTP and http protocols, and especially SMTP - email - which is so bad it's still not fixed 30 years later.
